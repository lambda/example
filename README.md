## Examples

This repo is for small, one-off examples to demonstrate something.  It
may contain a number of random, unrelated examples, just to have
somewhere to put them and push to share.

### Icons in GitHub README

You can embed images in your GitHub README.  You can use image tags,
or you could embed SVG directly.

* Image tag: `<img src="icons/rust.svg" width=20 height=20>` <img src="icons/rust.svg" width=20 height=20>

For these SVG images, you might want to style them, for example,
adding color.  GitHub sanitizes `<style>` tags in inline elements, so
you can't apply styling in your Markdown directly; and that styling
wouldn't apply to the SVG in the image either.  But you can just edit
the SVG itself; it supports styling with CSS just like HTML:

* Image tag: `<img src="icons/rust-red.svg" width=20 height=20>` <img src="icons/rust-red.svg" width=20 height=20>
